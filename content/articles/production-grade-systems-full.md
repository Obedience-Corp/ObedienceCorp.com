# Tested with Real Autonomous Workflows

Guild development is driven by real requirements for autonomous company operations. Not academic research. Not simplified demos. Infrastructure built to solve actual challenges in collaborative configuration and autonomous execution.

## Real-World Testing

**Domain-Specific Autonomous Operations**
- Tested with complex industry-specific workflows
- Autonomous decision-making in specialized domains
- Extended operations across multiple business functions
- Real decision offloading, not task automation

**Complex Decision Scenarios**
- Agents making judgment calls in ambiguous situations
- Quality decisions without human approval loops
- Escalation patterns tested under real conditions
- Configured criteria validated against actual outcomes

**Extended Autonomous Execution**
- Long-running operations spanning weeks
- Autonomous teams operating without constant oversight
- Context maintained across extended timeframes
- State consistency across interruptions and failures

## Built for Operational Reality

**Collaborative Configuration at Scale**
- Working WITH agents to configure complex workflows
- Iterative refinement of decision criteria
- Team structure evolution based on actual needs
- Real configuration complexity, not toy examples

**Decision Offloading Validation**
- Testing which decisions can be offloaded safely
- Refining escalation criteria through real usage
- Quality maintained through configured standards
- Autonomous judgment validated in production contexts

**Provider Reliability Under Real Conditions**
- Handling actual rate limits and service degradation
- Failover tested with real provider outages
- Cost optimization validated with actual usage patterns
- Multi-provider operations tested at scale

## What This Means

Guild isn't vaporware. Features exist because they were necessary to solve real problems:

**Collaborative Configuration Systems**
- Built to handle actual domain complexity
- Refined through real configuration challenges
- Validated with complex workflow requirements

**Decision Offloading Infrastructure**
- Tested with real judgment scenarios
- Proven to maintain quality at scale
- Validated across multiple domains

**Autonomous Execution Capabilities**
- Demonstrated in extended operations
- Proven reliable under real conditions
- Validated across diverse workflows

## No Theoretical Claims

We don't project what Guild "could" do. Documented features work in practice.

Tested with real autonomous workflows. Validated through actual usage. Built to solve problems that emerged during real autonomous operations.

## Obedience Corp's Approach

Build infrastructure that solves actual problems. Test under real conditions. Ship when it works reliably.

No demos that impress but don't deploy. No prototypes that work sometimes. Infrastructure for autonomous companies that actually operate.
