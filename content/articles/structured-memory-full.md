# Provider Agnostic Infrastructure

Guild works with any LLM provider. Your autonomous teams don't depend on any single vendor. Infrastructure built to outlive provider volatility.

## No Vendor Lock-In

The AI provider market changes rapidly:

- Pricing shifts unpredictably
- New providers enter constantly
- Model capabilities evolve continuously
- Terms of service change without warning

Organizations coupled to specific providers face continuous refactoring costs and negotiation weakness.

Guild decouples autonomous execution from provider implementation.

## Provider-Agnostic Architecture

**Unified Interface**

- Single configuration system regardless of backend
- Consistent behavior across different providers
- Provider-specific features through standardized abstractions
- Switch providers without reconfiguring workflows

**Multi-Provider Operations**

- Run different teams on different providers
- Optimize cost by routing to cheaper models
- Optimize performance with specialized models
- Maintain fallback providers for reliability

**Dynamic Provider Selection**

- Route based on current pricing and availability
- Automatically fail over to backup providers
- Test new providers without disrupting operations
- Switch seamlessly as market conditions change

## Cost Optimization

Provider agnosticism enables cost optimization:

**Task-Based Routing**

- Simple decisions to inexpensive models
- Complex judgment to capable models
- Automatic routing based on configured criteria
- Cost savings without quality degradation

**Market Responsiveness**

- Shift to providers with better pricing
- Negotiate from position of flexibility
- Volume distributed across providers
- No single point of pricing pressure

## Performance Optimization

Different providers excel at different capabilities:

**Model Specialization**

- Route to providers with optimal models
- Leverage specialized capabilities
- Mix providers within single workflows
- Best tool for each specific task

**Reliability Through Diversity**

- Provider outages don't halt operations
- Automatic failover to alternatives
- Distributed load reduces rate limiting
- Operational resilience through redundancy

## Stability Through Abstraction

Your configured teams remain stable while provider landscape shifts:

- New providers integrate without workflow rewrites
- Pricing changes don't force infrastructure redesign
- Model updates don't break autonomous execution
- Your investment in configuration outlives individual providers

## The Alternative

Organizations tightly coupled to specific providers:

- Refactoring costs when providers change terms
- Weak negotiating position (no alternatives)
- Operational risk from single point of failure
- Limited to capabilities of one provider ecosystem

## Guild's Approach

Provider agnostic from the foundation. Your autonomous company infrastructure outlives any individual vendor.

Configure once. Run on any provider. Switch seamlessly.

The AI landscape changes. Your autonomous teams remain stable.
