# The Collaboration Gap

No infrastructure exists to collaboratively configure autonomous AI teams that operate at Fortune 500 scale. Current tools keep humans in the micromanagement loop.

## The Micromanagement Trap

Current AI tools require constant human decisions:

**Chat Interfaces**
- Every task needs explicit human instruction
- Agents wait for your next command
- Context resets between conversations
- You remain the bottleneck

**Manual Task Assignment**
- You decide what each agent should do
- You route work between specialized tools
- You monitor progress manually
- Scaling requires more of your time

**Continuous Oversight**
- Agents can't make decisions without you
- Progress stops when you're unavailable
- Quality depends on constant review
- Your capacity limits the entire system

## What's Missing

Infrastructure for **collaborative configuration** plus **autonomous execution**:

1. Work WITH agents to define goals and preferences
2. Configure teams to make decisions like you would
3. Agents operate autonomously based on that configuration
4. Your decision-making capacity extends to Fortune 500 scale

Not faster task completion. Offloading entire categories of decisions to configured autonomous teams.

## The Opportunity

Build teams and departments of agents. Configure them to behave like your ideal employees. Collaborate on strategy. Let them execute autonomously.

One person commanding an autonomous organization.

Guild provides that infrastructure.
