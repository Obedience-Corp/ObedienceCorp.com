# Agent Specialization

## The Generalist Trap

General-purpose AI agents promise versatility. They can handle anything you throw at them.

In practice, generalists are:
- **Mediocre** at most tasks
- **Slow** because they waste cycles on irrelevant context
- **Expensive** because they load large, unfocused models
- **Unreliable** because their behavior varies by context

## The Case for Specialists

In human organizations, we don't hire "general workers." We hire:
- Accountants who do accounting
- Engineers who do engineering
- Lawyers who do legal work
- Marketers who do marketing

Each role is **specialized**. Each specialist is **excellent at their domain**.

AI systems should work the same way.

## Guild's Specialization Model

### Single-Purpose Agents
Each agent has:
- **One job** - Narrowly defined responsibility
- **One model** - Optimized for that specific task
- **One prompt** - Tuned for domain expertise
- **One output format** - Structured and validated

### The Benefits

**Performance**: Specialized prompts with minimal context produce better results faster.

**Cost**: Smaller, focused models are cheaper than large general models.

**Reliability**: Single-purpose agents have predictable behavior.

**Debugging**: When something breaks, you know exactly which agent failed.

## Building Specialized Guilds

Guild enables you to construct teams of specialists:

### Example: Code Review Guild
- **Style Agent**: Checks formatting and conventions
- **Security Agent**: Scans for vulnerabilities
- **Performance Agent**: Identifies optimization opportunities
- **Documentation Agent**: Verifies comments and docs
- **Testing Agent**: Analyzes test coverage

Each agent is small, fast, and excellent at its domain. Together, they provide comprehensive code review.

### Example: Content Production Guild
- **Research Agent**: Gathers information
- **Outline Agent**: Structures content
- **Writing Agent**: Generates prose
- **Editing Agent**: Improves clarity
- **SEO Agent**: Optimizes for search
- **Fact-Checking Agent**: Verifies accuracy

Each specialist contributes their expertise. The orchestra produces quality results.

## Composition Over Capability

Instead of one massive agent trying to do everything, Guild coordinates many specialists each doing one thing excellently.

This is how complex systems are built—through **composition of simple components**.

## The Result

With specialized agents:
- Tasks complete faster (parallel execution)
- Results are better (domain expertise)
- Costs are lower (right-sized models)
- Debugging is simpler (clear responsibility)
- Scaling is easier (add specialists as needed)

Specialization isn't a limitation. It's **how you build systems that work**.
