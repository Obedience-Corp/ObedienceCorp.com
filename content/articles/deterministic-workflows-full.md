# Collaborative Configuration, Autonomous Execution

Guild provides infrastructure for building autonomous companies. Not task automation. Complete systems for collaborative configuration and autonomous execution at Fortune 500 scale.

## Collaborative Configuration

**Define How Work Should Be Done**
- Collaborate with agents to establish workflows
- Set decision criteria and quality standards
- Configure team structures and reporting chains
- Establish escalation paths for edge cases

**Configure Star Employee Behavior**
- Define how agents should make decisions
- Set priorities and trade-off criteria
- Configure judgment calls for common scenarios
- Establish quality gates and validation rules

**Build Organizational Structure**
- Create teams with clear responsibilities
- Define departments and their relationships
- Set coordination protocols between groups
- Configure information flow and reporting

## Autonomous Execution

**Decision Offloading**
- Agents make quality decisions without approval loops
- Configured criteria guide judgment calls
- Escalation only when truly outside parameters
- Your decision-making capacity extends to 24/7 operation

**Persistent Operations**
- Teams work continuously without oversight
- Progress happens across dozens of parallel efforts
- Context maintains across days, weeks, months
- Autonomous problem-solving within configured bounds

**Quality Without Micromanagement**
- Standards enforced through configuration, not review
- Validation happens automatically at defined gates
- Deviations trigger escalation, not silent failure
- Quality maintained at scale without constant supervision

## Built for Scale

**Hierarchical Teams**
- Organize agents into teams, departments, divisions
- Clear reporting relationships and responsibilities
- Information flows through configured channels
- Coordination happens automatically

**Provider Flexibility**
- Works with any LLM provider
- Mix models within single workflows
- Optimize cost and performance dynamically
- No vendor lock-in or proprietary constraints

**Domain-Specific Configuration**
- Configure for your specific industry and workflows
- Domain knowledge embedded in team configuration
- Specialized judgment for niche requirements
- Autonomous execution of domain-specific processes

## The Result

Infrastructure that lets one person:
- Collaboratively configure autonomous teams
- Offload decision-making to configured agents
- Operate at Fortune 500 scale
- Maintain quality without micromanagement

Not faster task completion. Autonomous execution of entire business functions.
