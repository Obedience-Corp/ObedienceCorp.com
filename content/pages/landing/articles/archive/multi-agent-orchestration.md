Traditional development tools treat AI as a single monolithic entity. Guild treats AI as what it actually is: a distributed system of specialized agents.

Each agent has defined roles, access patterns, and execution constraints. Together, they form coordinated teams capable of autonomous software delivery.

One command. Coordinated execution. Zero drift.
