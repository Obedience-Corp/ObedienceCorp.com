# Production Terminal UI

Obey starts with a terminal interface. Here's why.

## Why Terminal First

**Where files live**

AI agents work with code, configs, and documents. The terminal is where those files already are. No upload dialogs. No sync issues. Direct access.

**Tools wire easily**

Pipe output. Chain commands. Integrate with git, make, scripts, whatever you already use. The terminal is the universal connector.

**Personalized workflows**

Everyone works differently. Terminal interfaces adapt to your patterns instead of forcing you into someone else's UX decisions.

**No context switching**

Editor to Obey and back in the same app. Stay in flow. The terminal is already where you're working.

## In Progress

**Multi-agent interface**

See and interact with multiple agents simultaneously. Switch contexts without losing state. Route work naturally.

**Session management**

Save sessions. Restore later. Export for documentation. Auto-recovery from interruptions.

**Real-time streaming**

See responses as they generate. Watch multiple agents work in parallel. Progress visible across your team.

**Speed**

Keyboard-first design. Vim keybindings. No mouse required. As fast as you can type.

## What Comes Next

The terminal version helps us build what comes after. Same orchestration engine, different interfaces. The non-developer version is coming—built by using the developer version daily.

## The Result

A terminal interface that fits how serious work actually happens.

Not a limitation. A foundation.
