# Provider Agnostic

Models matter less than the market currently believes.

## The Insight

With proper orchestration, you get the same end results with much less capable models. The secret is breaking work into smaller chunks.

Think about how companies work. People of varying intelligence come together. Each does their piece to spec. The whole exceeds what any individual could produce.

AI agents work the same way.

## The Strategy

**Big model for the plan**

Use your most capable model for high-level thinking. Architecture. Strategy. Decomposition. This is where intelligence matters most.

**Cheap model for execution**

Once the plan is clear, execution doesn't need genius. Smaller, faster, cheaper models can follow well-defined specs reliably.

**Right-size every task**

Match model capability to task complexity. Don't pay for power you don't need. Don't under-resource decisions that matter.

## Why This Matters

**Economics**

The cost difference between frontier and commodity models is enormous. Orchestration lets you use frontier models sparingly, commodity models heavily.

**Speed**

Smaller models are faster. When your execution layer runs on efficient models, throughput increases dramatically.

**Flexibility**

Models improve constantly. New providers emerge. Pricing shifts. When you're not locked to one model for everything, you adapt easily.

## The Result

Same quality output. Lower cost. Faster execution. Provider flexibility.

The orchestration layer is where the value lives. Models are interchangeable components.
