# Obey

AI agent orchestration framework for developers building production agent systems.

## What Obey Does

Obey coordinates multiple specialized AI agents working together on complex software projects. Not a chat interface. Not a single agent. A framework for building agent teams.

## Core Concepts

**Specialized Agents**

Each agent has a distinct role and capabilities. Backend agents write server code. Frontend agents handle UI. Test agents validate. Documentation agents explain. Each optimized for their domain.

**Hierarchical Configuration**

Organize context efficiently. Set it once at the right level, everything below inherits. No copy-pasting prompts between agents. No drift. No manual coordination.

**Persistent Context**

Context accumulates across sessions. Decisions inform future work. Agents build on what they learned instead of starting fresh every time.

## Key Capabilities

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**

Coordinate agents with different specializations. They work in parallel. Obey manages the workflow.

**Provider Agnostic**

Use any provider. Mix models in the same workflow. Best tool for each task. No vendor lock-in.

**Production TUI**

Terminal interface for developers. Multi-agent views. Real-time streaming. Session management. Built for the command line.

**Consistent Results**

Same hierarchy produces same results regardless of which model executes. Model differences show in speed, not output quality.

## The Result

Infrastructure for building teams of AI agents that actually work together.

Configure agents. Coordinate workflows. Scale beyond single-agent limits.
