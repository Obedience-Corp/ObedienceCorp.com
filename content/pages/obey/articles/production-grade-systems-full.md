# Proven in Production

Daily R&D since March 2025. Obey's architecture emerged from solving real workflow problems every day. Not theoretical research. Not toy demos. Patterns extracted from heavy AI agent usage across complex, long-running projects.

## Real Results

**Productivity Multiplied**

Engineers using these techniques consistently outperform similarly skilled engineers using other AI tools heavily. Not marginal gains. Multiples.

**System Proven**

The core architecture works. Multi-agent coordination, session persistence, provider switching, context management—all refined through actual use.

**Subsystems Working**

Individual components are operational. Festival planning system complete. Provider integrations stable. The pieces work.

## Current Status

**Core System**: Proven and working

**Remaining Work**: Unified UX to bring everything together

The hard problems are solved. What remains is packaging them into a cohesive interface.

## The Result

Infrastructure built by people who use AI agents daily for real work.

Not vaporware. Proven techniques awaiting final packaging.
