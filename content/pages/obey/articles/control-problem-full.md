# Organizational Abstraction

VPs don't manage 200 people directly. They manage at the right level of abstraction.

Obey applies the same principle to AI agents.

## The Abstraction

**You're the executive**

High-level decisions. Strategic direction. Initiative oversight.

**Sessions are your teams**

Each session handles its own complexity. Multiple agents working together. You don't need to track each one.

**Campaigns are your divisions**

Unified workspaces for related initiatives. Dozens of projects building in parallel with shared context.

## What This Enables

**Scale without overhead**

More agents doesn't mean more management burden. The abstraction handles the complexity growth.

**Right-level thinking**

You think about outcomes, not task routing. About initiatives, not individual agent prompts.

**Organizational workflows**

Build systems that automate how entire initiatives operate. Not just tasks. Entire operational patterns.

## The Result

One person managing what would normally require an entire management layer.

The complexity exists. It's just abstracted at the right level so you can actually manage it.
