# The Agent Reliability Problem

AI agents are powerful but unreliable. That's the gap Obey fills.

## What Goes Wrong

**Context Loss**

Sessions reset. Work forgotten. Agents repeat mistakes because they don't remember what happened yesterday.

**Coordination Failure**

Multiple agents working on the same project conflict, duplicate work, or produce contradictory outputs. You become the bottleneck manually coordinating everything.

**Inconsistent Results**

Same prompt, different outputs. Quality varies by model, by day, by phase of the moon. No repeatability.

**Task Abandonment**

Agents stop mid-execution. Complex workflows break. No recovery mechanism beyond starting over.

## How Obey Addresses This

**Persistent Memory**

Context carries across sessions. Decisions inform future work. Agents build on what they learned instead of starting fresh every time.

**Structured Coordination**

Hierarchy handles agent coordination. Teams know their roles. Work flows without your constant intervention.

**Consistency Through Architecture**

Same hierarchy, same results. Model differences show in speed, not output quality. Repeatable outcomes regardless of which AI executes.

**Session Recovery**

Work survives interruptions. State persists across failures. No lost progress.

## The Result

Agents that work reliably. Systems you can depend on. Infrastructure that makes the unreliable reliable.

Not hoping agents work. Building systems that ensure they do.
