# Work From Anywhere

Your AI organization shouldn't be tied to one machine. Obey runs where you run.

## Device Agnostic

**TUI first**

Terminal interface for power users. Keyboard-first. Fast. Where serious work happens.

**Mobile follows**

iPhone. iPad. Android. Same campaigns, same sessions, same control. Different screen.

**Desktop everywhere**

macOS. Linux. Windows. The daemon runs on your infrastructure. The client runs anywhere.

## Infrastructure Anywhere

**Central daemon**

Obey daemon runs on your main work machine. The brain of your AI organization.

**Remote campaigns**

Connect to campaigns running on VPS, other desktops, onsite servers. All appearing local.

**Unified view**

Doesn't matter where the compute lives. You see one coherent organization.

## The Result

Start work on your desktop. Continue on your iPad. Check progress from your phone.

Your AI workforce runs 24/7. You manage it from wherever you are.
