# The Scale Problem

Everyone is focused on model intelligence. AGI. Benchmarks. Who has the best reasoning.

That's the wrong problem.

## The Capability Already Exists

Current models can replicate the majority of human tasks. Faster. Often better.

The bottleneck isn't intelligence. It's direction.

## The Real Problem

We build tools and systems problem-by-problem. AI helps, but that approach only scales so far.

There's no executive layer. No way to direct thousands of capable subsystems toward a unified goal.

## What Obey Provides

Human civilization doesn't rely on the most intelligent people to do all work. We break work down. Distribute it across the population in manageable chunks. Create governance around it. Direct it toward a vision.

That's what Obey enables for AI.

**The decomposition:**

```
Vision & Strategy
└── Initiatives
    └── Projects
        └── Goals
            └── Subgoals
                └── Tasks (smallest reliable chunk)
```

**The abstraction hierarchy:**

```
Obey (Executive layer)
└── Campaigns (Initiatives)
    └── Projects (Focused work)
        └── Festivals
            └── Phases
                └── Sequences
                    └── Tasks
```

The abstraction goes as deep as needed. Theoretically infinite. Each layer handles its own complexity.

## The Result

Not smarter AI. Directed AI.

The intelligence exists. Obey makes it useful at scale.
