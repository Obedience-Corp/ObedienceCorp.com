# Beyond Chat Interfaces

Chat interfaces treat AI as a conversation partner. Obey treats AI as a coordinated workforce.

## The Chat Limitation

**Single agent, single thread**

One conversation. Context resets between sessions. No memory of past decisions. You remain the only coordinator.

**Manual coordination**

You route every task. You remember what each tool does. You handle all handoffs. You maintain all context.

**Linear interaction**

Prompt. Wait. Response. Repeat. One thing at a time. Progress bottlenecked by you.

## What Orchestration Enables

**Specialized agent teams**

Configure agents for specific roles. Backend work goes to backend agents. Frontend to frontend. Testing to test specialists. Each agent optimized for its domain.

**Automatic routing**

Direct work to the right agent naturally. Messages go where they need to go. Context flows without manual management.

**Persistent context**

Context accumulates across sessions. Decisions inform future work. Project knowledge builds over time. No starting from scratch every day.

**Parallel execution**

Multiple agents working simultaneously. See progress across the team. Not waiting for one completion to start another.

## The Shift

**From:** Chat assistant that waits for prompts

**To:** Agent team that executes coordinated work

Configure your agents. Route work naturally. Let Obey handle the coordination.

Not faster chat. Actual orchestration.
