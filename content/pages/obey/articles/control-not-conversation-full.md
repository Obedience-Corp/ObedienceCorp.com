# The Scale Problem

Everyone is focused on model intelligence. AGI. Benchmarks. Who has the best reasoning.

That's the wrong problem.

## The Capability Already Exists

Current models can replicate the majority of human tasks. Faster. Often better.

The bottleneck isn't intelligence. It's direction.

## The Real Problem

We build tools and systems problem-by-problem. AI helps, but that approach only scales so far.

There's no executive layer. No way to direct thousands of capable subsystems toward a unified goal.

## What Obey Provides

A corporate org structure for AI. Break goals into sub-goals. Direct complex systems at scale.

**The abstraction hierarchy:**
- Obey: The organization
- Campaigns: Initiatives
- Projects: Focused work
- Festivals: Task execution

The abstraction goes as deep as needed. Theoretically infinite. Each layer handles its own complexity.

## The Result

Not smarter AI. Directed AI.

The intelligence exists. Obey makes it useful at scale.
