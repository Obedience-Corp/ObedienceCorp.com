# Obey

Run an AI organization at executive scale.

## The Scale

Imagine you're a VP with 20+ teams of 5-10 people each. That's 100-200 people. You can't manage them all directly. You need abstraction.

Obey lets you manage hundreds of agents the same way. Not by tracking each one, but by managing at the right level of abstraction.

## How It Works

**Campaigns**

A campaign is a workspace for a unified initiative. Related projects that share context. One campaign might have dozens of projects building in parallel.

**Sessions**

Each session can have multiple agents working together. Visualize how they coordinate. Monitor progress. See what's happening without micromanaging.

**Festivals**

See festival progress across everything. Know which phase, which sequence, which task. Monitor execution at whatever level makes sense.

## What This Enables

**Organizational Workflows**

Build systems that automate complex organizational workflows. Not just tasks, but how entire initiatives operate.

**Executive Decisions**

Make high-level decisions. The abstraction handles team-level complexity. You focus on what matters.

**Scale Without Overhead**

More agents. More sessions. More campaigns. Same mental overhead. The complexity doesn't grow linearly with scale.

## The Result

One person managing what would normally require an entire management layer.

Hundreds of agents. One window. Executive control.
