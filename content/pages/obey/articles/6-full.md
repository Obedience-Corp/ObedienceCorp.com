# Proven in Production

Obey's architecture emerged from solving real organizational problems. Daily. Since March 2025.

Not theoretical research. Not demos. Patterns extracted from actually running an AI organization.

## Real Results

**Productivity multiplied**

One person managing what would typically require teams. Not marginal gains. Order of magnitude improvement.

**Scale validated**

Hundreds of agents. Multiple campaigns. Dozens of parallel projects. The organizational model works.

**Patterns proven**

Campaign structure. Session management. Festival-based execution. All refined through actual use.

## Current Status

**Core architecture**: Proven and working

**Festival planning**: Complete and operational

**What's next**: Unified interface to bring everything together

The hard organizational problems are solved. What remains is packaging them into a cohesive product.

## The Result

Infrastructure built by someone who runs an AI organization daily.

Not vaporware. Proven techniques awaiting final packaging.
