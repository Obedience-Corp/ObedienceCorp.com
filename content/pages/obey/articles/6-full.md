# Proven in Production

This R&D created more than architecture. It created a daily development workflow and tool suite that has been used to ship AAA gaming backends, blockchain developer tool suites, trading compliance systems. Niche, deeply technical products that are used daily in production

In some cases, delivered what multiple years and significant capital investment could not, in months while development was done in parallel.

## The Workflow

Campaigns and festivals aren't just concepts. They're a daily practice. Every project, every feature, every complex system we build is built using these techniques.

The tooling evolved through constant use and actual needs. What works gets refined. What doesn't gets cut.

## Real Results

**Multiple parallel products shipped shipped**

Complete developer tool ecosystems, blockchain gaming backends, trading compliance systems with CRM integration. Products that provided real value to companies who had struggled to build these systems for years.

Not demos. Not prototypes. Production systems handling real load, real users, real money.

**Compressed timelines**

In one case, a system that had over 90M in prior investment was built in 6 months, in another case an app that had 1.5 years of development with nothing useful to show was rebuilt and launched to fully replace a complex manual workflow in 3 months.

## What This Demonstrates

**The techniques work**

Battle-tested daily since March 2025. Refined through real shipping pressure, real engineering workflows, not theoretical research.

**Continuous improvement and Daily Feedback**

We use our own products on a daily basis, if a subsystem isn't useful in obey until a later date, we build products we can use or launch based on the subsystem to speed up our feedback loop.

The obey ecosystem improves daily, often with exponential improvements in quality, speed and reduction in token usage for the same result.

## Subsystems Turned Products

**[Brainyard](https://brainyard.ai)**

Multi-agent chat application. Based on the orchestration system developed for early Obey ([guild-core](https://github.com/lancekrogers/guild-core)).

**[Anywhr](https://www.anywr.ai/)**

Shared context workspace for teams and communities. Built on Obey's campaign RAG system. Built during Christmas 2025.
