# Hierarchical Configuration

An adaptable project planning system built for AI agents.

## The Problem

AI agents struggle with large, ambiguous goals. They lose track. They skip steps. They forget what they were trying to accomplish.

## The Solution

Break goals into hierarchy. Check quality at each level. Compare results against intent.

**Multi-level structure**

Goals break into phases. Phases break into sequences. Sequences break into tasks. Each level has clear success criteria.

**Quality gates**

Don't proceed until the current step meets spec. Check work against goals before moving forward. Catch drift early.

**Adaptable depth**

Simple work needs simple structure. Complex work gets more levels. The system adapts to the project, not the other way around.

## How It Works

**Start with the goal**

What are you actually trying to accomplish? Define success criteria upfront.

**Break it down**

Decompose into manageable pieces. Each piece small enough for an agent to complete without losing context.

**Execute and verify**

Work through the hierarchy. Check each step against its goals. Adjust when reality doesn't match the plan.

**Iterate**

Plans change. The structure supports revision without losing progress.

## Why This Works

Same principle as organizations with people of varying capabilities. Break work into pieces sized for the person doing it. Verify against spec. Coordinate the whole.

Agents work the same way. Give them appropriately sized chunks with clear success criteria. They deliver.

## The Result

Projects that stay on track. Work that matches intent. Quality that compounds instead of degrades.

Structure that makes agents reliable.
