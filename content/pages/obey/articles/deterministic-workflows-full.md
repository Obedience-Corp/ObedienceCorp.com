# Campaigns

A campaign is a workspace for a unified initiative. Related projects that share context. The organizational unit that makes scale manageable.

## The Structure

**Campaign level**

The initiative. Your company's AI infrastructure. A product launch. A research program. Whatever needs unified coordination.

**Sessions within campaigns**

Each session represents focused work. Multiple agents collaborating on a specific goal. Many sessions can run simultaneously.

**Agents within sessions**

The actual workforce. Different models, different specializations, all coordinated by the session structure.

## What Campaigns Enable

**Parallel execution**

Dozens of projects building at once. Different sessions, different goals, same campaign context.

**Shared knowledge**

Context flows between sessions. Decisions in one place inform work elsewhere. No siloed agents.

**Cross-machine coordination**

Campaigns can span multiple machines. Your desktop, VPS, servers. All appearing as one unified workspace.

## The Result

One campaign. Many projects. Hundreds of agents.

All organized, all visible, all manageable from a single view.
