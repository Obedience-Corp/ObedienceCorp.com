# Campaigns

Workspaces for unified initiatives. But you don't run just one.

## The Multiplication

**Campaigns in parallel**

Run 5, 10, or more campaigns simultaneously. Each is an independent initiative with its own context.

**Projects per campaign**

Each campaign can have dozens of projects building in parallel. Related work that shares context.

**Agents per project**

One agent per project is often more effective than multiple agents on the same work. But you can configure it either way.

## The Math

```
5 campaigns × 5 projects × 1 agent = 25 agents
10 campaigns × 10 projects × 1 agent = 100 agents
10 campaigns × 10 projects × 2 agents = 200 agents
```

Nothing is limited. Scale as deep as you need.

## What This Enables

**Multiplicative scale**

Small numbers at each level compound into large workforce capacity.

**Flexible configuration**

More campaigns with fewer agents each. Fewer campaigns with more projects. Whatever matches your work.

**Single view**

All campaigns. All projects. All agents. One window.

## The Result

The scale multiplies. The interface stays simple.
