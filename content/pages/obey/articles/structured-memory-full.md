# Complexity Abstraction

Plan every micro decision without actually planning them.

## The Problem

Complex projects have thousands of decisions. Architecture choices. Implementation details. Edge cases. Error handling. Testing strategies.

Planning all of this manually doesn't scale. You'd spend more time planning than building.

## How Abstraction Works

**Hierarchical Decomposition**

High-level goals decompose into phases. Phases into sequences. Sequences into tasks. Each level handles its own detail.

You define what you want. The system decomposes how to get there.

**Quality Gates**

Every level has checkpoints. Testing. Review. Validation. Quality is structural, not optional.

You don't manually verify each step. The structure enforces it.

**Execution Tracking**

See progress at any level. Know what's done, what's in progress, what's next. All without micromanaging.

## What This Enables

**Scale Without Complexity**

More projects. More parallel work. Same mental overhead. The abstraction handles the growth.

**CEO-Level Management**

Make high-level decisions. Delegate details to the structure. Focus on what matters.

**Consistent Quality**

Quality gates run automatically. Nothing ships without passing. No manual checklist required.

## The Result

Plan at the level that matters. Let abstraction handle the rest.

You're the CEO of your agents, not their manager.
