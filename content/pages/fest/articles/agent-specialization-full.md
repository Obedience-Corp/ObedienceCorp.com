# Context Preservation

Festival Methodology maintains context through structure, not documentation tricks.

## The Problem

AI conversations lose context:
- Session ends, context gone
- Tomorrow starts from scratch
- Decisions forgotten
- Progress unclear

Multi-day projects become impossible without structure.

## How Structure Preserves Context

**Context chains through hierarchy**

The festival structure itself is the context preservation mechanism. Each level provides context for the level below:

- Festival goal informs phase goals
- Phase goals inform sequence goals
- Sequence goals inform task work
- Task work connects back to festival purpose

An agent working on a task understands why that task exists—because the structure makes the chain explicit.

**Goal documents at every level**

Each level has a goal document defining success criteria. When an agent starts work, it reads up the chain:
- What is this task trying to accomplish?
- What sequence does it belong to?
- What phase is that sequence serving?
- What festival are we completing?

Context flows through the hierarchy naturally.

**Work products become context**

Completed tasks become context for future tasks. The structure preserves what was done:
- Completed phases inform current work
- Sequence outputs feed into next sequences
- Progress is visible and traceable

## Multi-Day Continuity

Day 1: Complete Phase 1

Day 2: Start Phase 2—but Phase 1's outputs are there. The structure captured what happened. The agent reads the hierarchy and continues.

No special handoff documents needed. The work itself is the context.

## Why This Works

**Structure is durable**

Files in a hierarchy don't disappear between sessions. The festival structure persists exactly as it was left.

**Hierarchy is navigable**

An agent can always trace back up the chain to understand purpose. Why this task? Check the sequence goal. Why this sequence? Check the phase goal.

**Progress is visible**

What's done, what's in progress, what's next—all encoded in the structure. Status is state, not documentation.

## The Result

AI can work on projects spanning days or weeks.

Context accumulates through structure. Each level informs the next. Long-running autonomous work becomes possible.
