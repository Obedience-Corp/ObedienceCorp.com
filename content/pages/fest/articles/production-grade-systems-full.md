# Self-Improving System

Fest CLI improves itself using its own methodology.

## The Feedback Loop

1. **Agents use fest** - They execute festivals, navigate hierarchy, track progress
2. **Agents give feedback** - Pain points, friction, suggestions for improvement
3. **Feedback becomes a festival** - Improvements are planned using the methodology
4. **Fest gets better** - Changes ship, agents benefit
5. **Repeat daily**

The tool that manages AI work is itself improved by AI work.

## Why This Matters

Most software improves through human observation and manual iteration. Fest improves through direct agent feedback at scale.

Every agent session is a beta test. Every friction point is captured. Every improvement benefits all future sessions.

## The Results

- **94% token reduction** - Agents load only what they need
- **Nearly 100% execution accuracy** - Plans execute exactly as specified
- **1000+ hours production usage** - Consistent across Claude Code, Codex, various models
- **Daily improvements** - The system gets better continuously

## Bootstrapping

Fest was used to build fest. The methodology was used to formalize the methodology.

This isn't theoretical. It's operational. Running daily since May 2025.

## What This Enables

A system that:
- Learns from its own usage
- Fixes its own pain points
- Improves its own performance
- Gets better without manual intervention

**AI that makes itself better.**
