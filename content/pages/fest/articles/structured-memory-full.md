# Visualization

Fest CLI gives you complete visibility into what agents will do, are doing, and have done.

## See Before They Do

Every festival is a complete plan. Before any agent executes, you see:

- Every phase, sequence, and task
- The full hierarchy of work
- Dependencies and order of execution

No surprises. You approve the plan before work begins.

## See During Execution

While agents work autonomously:

- Know exactly which task they're on
- See progress through sequences and phases
- Track multiple festivals simultaneously

Manage many large-scale projects building at the same time.

## Audit Trail

After execution:

- What they did
- When they did it
- Verification that claims match reality

If an agent says it completed a task, you can verify. Quickly spot mistakes, understand why they happened, adjust for next time.

## Reduced Review Burden

High visibility means high confidence. You don't need to review every line of code. The structure tells you:

- What was supposed to happen
- What actually happened
- Where to look if something's wrong

**Total visibility. Zero surprises.**
