# Steps, Not Time

Traditional project management assumes human execution. Festival Methodology assumes AI execution.

## The Time Problem

**Traditional PM**

- "This feature will take 2 weeks"
- "Sprint capacity is 40 story points"
- "Estimate in hours, track in days"
- "Review in standup tomorrow"

Time-based planning assumes predictable human velocity.

**AI Reality**

- AI executes 30-100x faster than humans
- Speed varies by task complexity, not skill
- Work happens 24/7 when configured
- "2 weeks" might be "4 hours"

Time estimates become meaningless.

## The Step Alternative

Festival Methodology plans in **logical steps toward goals**, not time estimates.

**Festival Planning**

```
Phase: Build Authentication
├── Sequence: Research existing auth
│   ├── Task: Analyze current codebase
│   ├── Task: Document patterns used
│   └── Task: Identify integration points
├── Sequence: Implement login flow
│   ├── Task: Create auth service
│   ├── Task: Build login endpoint
│   ├── Task: Add session management
│   └── Quality gates (test, review)
└── Sequence: Deploy and validate
    ├── Task: Integration tests
    └── Task: Documentation
```

Steps are concrete. Order is logical. No time attached.

## Why Steps Work Better

**Clarity**

- Each step has clear success criteria
- No ambiguity about "80% done"
- Either complete or not

**Progress Tracking**

- Count completed steps
- Calculate percentage
- Know exactly where you are

**AI Compatibility**

- AI can execute clear steps
- No interpretation of vague estimates
- Concrete deliverables per task

**Human Oversight**

- Review at step boundaries
- Quality gates at sequence ends
- Control without micromanagement

## The Velocity Question

"How do I know when it will be done?"

**With Festival Methodology:**

1. Count total steps
2. Track completion rate
3. Project remaining time

AI velocity becomes observable through step completion, not estimated through guesswork.

## Example

**Traditional:**
> "Authentication feature - Est: 2 weeks"

**Festival:**
```
Phase: Authentication (12 tasks)
├── Research (3 tasks) ✓
├── Implementation (6 tasks) - 4 complete
└── Deployment (3 tasks) - pending

Progress: 7/12 tasks (58%)
Current: Implementing session management
```

Which tells you more about actual status?

## The Shift

Stop asking: "How long will this take?"
Start asking: "What steps are needed?"

AI doesn't need deadlines. It needs clear steps to execute.

Define the work. Let AI do it. Track by completion.
