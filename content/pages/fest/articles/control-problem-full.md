# Hierarchical Structure

Festival Methodology organizes complex projects into manageable pieces.

## The Levels

**Festival**

The complete project. Defines what success looks like, key deliverables, and boundaries.

**Phase**

A major milestone. Phases represent distinct stages—research, planning, implementation, review, deployment.

**Sequence**

A unit of related work within a phase. Groups tasks toward a specific goal.

**Task**

A single piece of executable work. Concrete enough for an AI agent to complete.

## Why Hierarchy Works

**Prevents overwhelm**

A project might have 100+ tasks. Flat lists become unmanageable. Hierarchy keeps things navigable at every level.

**Enables focus**

Work on one task at a time while understanding which sequence it completes, which phase that serves, and what the festival achieves. Context without overwhelm.

**Supports quality gates**

Each level has a goal document defining success. Check work against goals before proceeding. Catch drift early.

**Adaptable depth**

Simple projects need less structure. Complex projects get more levels. The system adapts to the work.

## The Result

Complex projects broken into manageable phases, focused sequences, and executable tasks.

Each level has clear goals. Progress is always measurable. Quality compounds instead of degrades.
